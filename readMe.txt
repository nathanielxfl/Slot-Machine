This is apart of the term project for my Client-side Web Scripting class. We were tasked with learning a JavaScript framework/library and create an application using the framework/library.
Users provide their username and a security token then are allowed to play several games of slots. The game terminates in two ways: the user runs out of money to play with or decides to walk away. Once the game is complete, their game session details are logged into local storage, similar to when you play an arcade game and enter your information for the leaderboard. Since the information is put into local storage, that data will be there regardless of whether the browsing sessions ends or not. Additionally, there is an additional part of application where employees can enter their credentionals then be provided access to the game history. That game history would contain information on all of the games ever played from that web browser.
